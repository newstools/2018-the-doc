9 March 2017 Government urges the public to participate on Voter Registration Weekend Government calls upon all eligible South African voters to visit their voting stations this coming weekend. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) will on the 10 and 11 March, open 22 600 voting registration centres across the country. Minister of Communications, Nomvula Mokonyane, said: “For the country to have a successful 2019 general election, the IEC must ensure that its voter’s roll is legitimately updated.  We therefore call upon all citizens to play their part by registering and updating their addresses on the voter’s roll. Those who are 17-years-old or who will be voting for the first time are called upon to register. It is your democratic right to vote and make your voice heard. Your contribution to the election process plays an instrumental role in the future of our country.” Voters must visit the voting station in their voting district. The voting stations will be open between 08:00 am and 17:00 pm to assist new voters to register.  To find your correct voting station, please call the Electoral Commission’s contact centre on 0800 11 8000 or go to https://www.elections.org.za/MyIEC/. The Department of Home Affairs will also be open during the weekend to assist with issuing of the temporary identity documents. “The registration process is significant as it is the culmination of the values and beliefs of two great struggle stalwarts namely former president Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu, who fought for a democratic South Africa. During this Centenary year, let us ‘Be the Legacy’ and protect our hard fought for freedom. We call on all the citizens to go out in numbers to ensure that their details are correct so that they can exercise their right to vote,” added Minister Mokonyane.
