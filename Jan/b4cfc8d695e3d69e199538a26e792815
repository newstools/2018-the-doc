31 January 2018 Government notes the announcement made by Multichoice to remove Africa News Network 7 channel from the DSTV bouquet when the contract expires in August 2018. As previously stated, Communications Minister Kubayi-Ngubane reiterates that government will not get involved on contractual matters between two private parties. “I wish to express my disappointment that the viewers of DSTV will not have access to the diversity of voices that ANN7 has also contributed to the country’s media landscape. However there is a lesson to be learned going forward in that, as government we need to look at how our current policies are structured in relation to increasing diversity of media ownership” said Minister Kubayi-Ngubane. On the same note, government is pleased on the progressive move by Multichoice to find a new black owned news channel to represent majority of people in South Africa. “It is imperative to ensure that there is diversity of media ownership bringing new and fresh perspective to the people of South Africa” said Minister Kubayi-Ngubane.
