 The Minister of Communications, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane will tomorrow, 25 January 2018 address the Regional Gender Sensitization Workshop at Zimbali Fairmount in Durban. The workshop is hosted by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) Africa Region in partnership with the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature. The purpose is to develop strategies to increase Women’s role in Parliaments, Legislatures and other highest decision making bodies in societies in the African Region. The CPA Africa Region in its last sitting in 2016 in Accra Ghana, resolved to organize a Regional Gender Sensitization Workshop in KwaZulu-Natal. This workshop will be held under the theme, “Mechanism to Strengthen Gender Equality”. The theme of the workshop is in line with Goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals which seeks to “Promote Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women”. The main concern of the CPA Africa Region is the lack or slow progress made in societies regarding the significant gaps that exist, for example in the labor market and general participation of women in key decision making areas in both the public and private sectors.
